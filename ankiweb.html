This add-on offers to export the the selection from the browser - either the cards or the underlying notes. When exporting cards you can export metadata and not just field contents or the question/answer template. So you can export interval, due dates, card id, etc.

you can export to csv or xlsx (Excel format). This might be useful in some cases to avoid problems with quoting and field separators.

When exporting the underlying notes and you export to csv one file per note type is exported (or one xlsx file with one worksheet per notetype).

When exporting to csv you can set multiple characters as the field delimiter in the add-on config. You can also set some parameters for python's csv exporter in the add-on config.

This add-on does NOT allow to import from xlsx. There's no add-on that offers this and it's unlikely that such an add-on would be useful: As far as I see in 2019-11 there's no FOSS library that makes reading richtext from Excel files easy.

I made this add-on for myself. So it's not much tested. Use it at your own risk. 

<b>Errors, Bugs, Issues</b>
Feedback, improvements, and error reports are welcome. It's best to post these in <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/export_selected_cards_or_notes_from_browser_with_metadata_to_csv_or_xlsx" rel="nofollow">my github repo</a> or send me a message via reddit (/u/ijgnord/) where I can respond multiple times.

<b>Known Limitations</b>
When exporting cards this add-on is slow. Exporting over 40000 cards took between 2 and 4 minutes on my computer! It's slow because I reused existing components that were designed for a different use case.

<b>Alternatives</b>
If you know some sql you can query the Anki database directly, see <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Database-Structure" rel="nofollow">a brief description of the Anki2 database structure.</a>.

There are about 20 different exporting related add-ons. It's likely that in many cases this add-on is not the best suited for you. If this add-on doesn't work for you search the other available ones. I really like Arthur Milchior's <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1983204951" rel="nofollow">Export cards selected in the Browser</a>.

For exporting metadata in 2019-11 there's only (<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/46837454" rel="nofollow">Export Browser's card list contents to CSV file Enhanced</a>) which is only available for the old version 2.0 which will <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/announcements/136-sunsetting-anki-20-support" rel="nofollow">stop syncing in 2020-01-01</a>.

There's also an unpublished add-on by glutanimate named <a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/custom-text-backup" rel="nofollow">custom-text-backup</a> (for 2.0 and 2.1) that allows to export some metadata. But this doesn't export to a table, spreadsheet, or csv file and instead creates free-form text (like one file per note/card).

For an overview of export related add-ons see <a href="" rel="nofollow">this list</a> (as of 2019-11-15)

<b>Configuration</b>
You can set which fields or metadata to export from the add-on configuration. You can also configure some parameters for the csv export in the add-on settings. The settings window has some explanations.
